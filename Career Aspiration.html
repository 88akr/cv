It would be great prospect for me if I get a chance to work in a creative, challenging and dynamic milieu where I can build up my career and contribute to the betterment of society. I am a self-motivated individual, honest and responsible about my work. I am also a team player and like to lead and be led as well as focus on solving problems through creative solutions.
